        ## For Developers
        
        ### Feature Analysis Framework:
        
        #### 1. Requirements Analysis
        - **User story validation:** Ensure the user story follows "As a [user], I want [goal] so that [benefit]"
        - **Scope definition:** Clearly define what's included/excluded in this feature
        - **Dependencies:** Identify any other features or systems this depends on
        
        #### 2. Technical Considerations
        - **Database changes:** Will this require new collections or schema modifications?
        - **API changes:** What new endpoints or modifications to existing endpoints are needed?
        - **Frontend changes:** What UI/UX components need to be added or modified?
        - **Authentication:** Does this feature require role-based access control?
        
        #### 3. Implementation Approach
        
        **Frontend Components:**
        - New UI elements needed in `src/static/index.html`
        - JavaScript functionality in `src/static/app.js`
        - CSS styling requirements
        
        **Backend Components:**
        - New routes in `src/backend/routers/`
        - Database model changes in `src/backend/database.py`
        - Authentication/authorization requirements
        
        **Database Considerations:**
        - New collections or document structure changes
        - Data migration requirements for existing data
        - Index requirements for performance
        
        #### 4. Testing Strategy
        - **Unit tests:** What functions/methods need testing?
        - **Integration tests:** What workflows need end-to-end testing?
        - **User acceptance testing:** How will teachers verify the feature works?
        
        #### 5. Documentation Updates
        - README updates
        - API documentation
        - User guides for teachers
