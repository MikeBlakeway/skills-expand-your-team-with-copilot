# Issue Templates Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved
Teachers were not comfortable modifying code directly and didn't know what information to provide in GitHub issues for change requests. This created a barrier to maintaining and updating the school's activity management system.

## Solution Implemented
Created a comprehensive set of GitHub issue template forms that guide teachers through requesting changes with all necessary technical details automatically captured.

## Templates Created

### 1. Add New Activity Template
**Purpose**: Request addition of new extracurricular activities
**Key Features**:
- Activity name, description, and category selection
- Schedule configuration with day/time selection
- Participant capacity and supervisor information  
- Developer guidance with database schema examples
- Implementation checklist for testing

### 2. Modify Existing Activity Template  
**Purpose**: Request changes to existing activities
**Key Features**:
- Dropdown selection of existing activities
- Granular change selection (name, schedule, capacity, etc.)
- Reasoning for changes required
- Handles participant impact considerations
- Preserves data integrity guidelines

### 3. Remove Activity Template
**Purpose**: Safely remove activities from system
**Key Features**:
- Activity selection and removal confirmation
- Participant handling options (transfer/notify)
- Timeline specification for removal
- Data backup and cleanup guidance
- Authority confirmation checkboxes

### 4. Bug Report Template
**Purpose**: Report system issues and problems  
**Key Features**:
- Problem area identification (registration, display, etc.)
- Reproduction steps and frequency assessment
- Device/browser information capture
- Impact level classification
- Developer debugging guidance

### 5. Feature Request Template
**Purpose**: Request new functionality
**Key Features**:
- Feature categorization and user story format
- Priority assessment and success criteria
- Current workaround documentation
- Technical suggestion capture
- Implementation framework for developers

### 6. UI/Display Change Template
**Purpose**: Request interface improvements
**Key Features**:
- Interface area identification
- Current problem and desired change description
- User impact assessment and device context
- Accessibility consideration prompts
- UI/UX implementation guidelines

## Technical Implementation

### Structure
- **Location**: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` directory
- **Format**: YAML form templates using GitHub's issue form syntax
- **Validation**: All templates validated for correct YAML syntax
- **Configuration**: `config.yml` disables blank issues and provides helpful links

### Developer Support Features
Each template includes:
- **Implementation guidance** with specific code locations
- **Database schema examples** for data structure changes  
- **Testing checklists** to ensure quality assurance
- **Technical considerations** for common edge cases
- **Code snippets** showing expected implementation patterns

### User Experience Features
- **Clear categorization** with descriptive names and purposes
- **Progressive disclosure** showing only relevant fields
- **Required field validation** to ensure complete information
- **Helpful placeholder text** with realistic examples
- **Context-aware options** based on existing system data

## Benefits Achieved

### For Teachers
- ✅ No technical knowledge required
- ✅ Guided forms ensure complete information
- ✅ Clear categories for different request types
- ✅ Immediate submission without code interaction

### For Developers  
- ✅ Structured requirements with implementation details
- ✅ Consistent format for automated processing
- ✅ Clear acceptance criteria and testing guidelines
- ✅ Reduced back-and-forth clarification needs

### For the School System
